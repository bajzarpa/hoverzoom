### Why does this extension need access to my browsing history and my data on all websites? ###

Hover Zoom modifies the pages you are browsing, just like many other extensions (ad blockers for instance). It requires permissions that trigger those warnings. It doesn't, however, read through your browsing history or private data.

### When installing Hover Zoom, I get an error message `"Invalid value for content_scripts[0].matches[0]"` or `"Invalid value for permissions[1]"` ###

This usually happens when your version of Google Chrome is out of date.
Update it then try installing Hover Zoom again.

### Hover Zoom doesn't work with Google Image Search ###

~~You have to move the mouse cursor over the blue text link below the thumbnail.~~

~~In august of 2010, Google introduced a new version of Image Search, with a similar "zoom on mouse over" feature. To avoid being redundant, Hover Zoom has been designed so that the zoomed image is displayed only when the mouse cursor goes over the text link.~~

Google released a new version of Google Image Search during the summer of 2011 that makes it much more difficult to load zoomed images. Support for this site has been suspended until a fix is found.

### I have found a issue that is not discussed here. Where do I report it? ###
